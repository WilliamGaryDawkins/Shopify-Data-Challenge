# Shopify-Data-Challenge
My submission for the Shopify 2021 Fall Data Challenge

For question 1 of the challenge I worked in R, specifically using Tidyverse and ggplot2 to analyze the data and answer the questions. I used Rmarkdown to produce a pdf of my analysis including code chunks to show how I worked through the anaysis

The answers for question 2 are included at the end of the pdf along with the SQL queries used to obtain them
